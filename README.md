# Stock-Anomaly-Detection
This project is part of a Bloomberg-sponsored research initiative, where I focused on identifying anomalies in the stock price behavior of companies within the Russell 3000 index.

I applied machine learning techniques including Isolation Forests and Transformer-based Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to detect abnormal price movements based on features such as residual returns, trading volume, and major market events. These models were trained on historical stock data and evaluated across various time windows and sectors.

To make the insights more accessible, I built an interactive dashboard that allows users to:

- Select specific tickers and time ranges

- Compare the outputs of different anomaly detection models

- Visualize abnormal patterns through dynamic charts

The goal of this project is to develop a scalable, interpretable, and user-friendly anomaly detection framework that supports systematic trading and investment research.
